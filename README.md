# rice_image_detection_cnn
In the dataset there are 5 types(or 5 classes) of rice images namely Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, Karacadag.
These contains 15000 images each and a total of 60000 images.

The dataset is collected from kaggle.
The link of the kaggle dataset iis given below.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset

This project is based upon single class image recognition.
The model is based upon Convolutional Neural Network.

The model predicts that what type of rice is in the given image.
The model is build using a tool named tensorflow(by google) and using Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda Navigator.

The code is given in the repository.
The model.pkl file is also given in the repository.

Thank you.
